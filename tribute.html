            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia, Mother Teresa was baptized the following day as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhui. Her parents, Nikola and Dranafile Bojaxhui were of Albanian Descent. Her father worked as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines. Nikola was a vocal proponent involved in the local church as well as in city politics. In 1919, her father died due to unknown reasons while there were speculations that he was poisoned by political enemies. Later, Agnes became attached to her mother who instilled in her a deep commitment to charity. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Agnes went to a convent-run primary school and then a state-run secondary school. She used to sing solos in the local Sacred Heart choir and from there she first felt a calling to religious life at the age of 12. Six years later, in 1928, an 18-year-old Agnes decided to become a nun and set off for Ireland to join the sisters of Loreto in Dublin. It was there that she took the name Sister Mary Teresa after Saint Theresa of Liseux.</p>

            <br>
            <p>A year later, Sister Mary Teresa travelled to Darjeeling, India for the Novitiate Period. In May 1931, She made her first profession of vows. Later, She went to Calcutta, where she was assigned to teach at Saint Mary’s High School for Girls, a school run by the Loreto sisters and dedicated to teaching girls from the city’s poorest Bengali families. On May 24, 1937, She took her final profession of vows to a life of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Later, she took on the title “Mother” upon making her final vows and became Mother Teresa. She continued her teaching and lead them to a life of devotion to Christ</p>
            <br>
            <p>On September 10, 1946, Mother Teresa experienced a second calling, “Call within a Call” that transformed her life forever. When she was travelling for the retreat from Calcutta to the Himalayan foothills, a christ abandoned the teaching work and served in Calcutta’s poorer & sicker slum areas. In 1948, she finally received approval to pursue this new calling. Donning the blue and white saree that she would wear in public for the rest of her life, she left the Loreto Convent and wandered out into the city. She voyaged in the slums of Calcutta with a goal, “the unwanted, the unloved, the uncared for”.</p>

            <h2>Missionaries of Charity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>On October 7, 1950, Mother Teresa received permission from the Holy See to start her own order, “The Missionaries of Charity”, whose primary task was to love and care for those persons nobody was prepared to look after. In 1965 the Society became an International Religious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The Society of Missionaries has spread all over the world, including the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. They provide effective help to the poorest of the poor in a number of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and they undertake relief work in the wake of natural catastrophes such as floods, epidemics, and famine, and for refugees. The order also has houses in North America, Europe and Australia, where they take care of the shut-ins, alcoholics, homeless, and AIDS sufferers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Missionaries of Charity throughout the world are aided and assisted by Co-Workers who became an official International Association on March 29, 1969. By the 1990s there were over one million Co-Workers in more than 40 countries. Along with the Co-Workers, the lay Missionaries of Charity try to follow Mother Teresa’s spirit and charism in their families.</p>

            <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
            <br>

            <h2>Saint in the Gutter - and Saint in Heaven</h2>
            <br>
            <p>At the age of twelve, the Catholic Albanian girl Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu heard a call. God demanded that she devote her life to Him. She entered a nunnery, received an education, and was sent to Calcutta in India to be a teacher. Her new name was Teresa. In India she received a second call from God: to help the poor while living among them. She founded a new sisterhood, Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa and her helpers built homes for orphans, nursing homes for lepers and hospices for the terminally ill in Calcutta. Mother Teresa's organization also engaged in aid work in other parts of the world</p>

            <br>
            <p>The modest nun became known all over the world, and money poured in. But she was also criticized. It was alleged that dying people in the hospices were refused pain relief, whereas Mother Teresa herself accepted hospital treatment. She also held a conservative view on abortion. She was regarded as a spokesperson for the Vatican. In 2003, the Pope took the first step towards her canonization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In March 1997, Due to failing health, she steps aside and is replaced by Sister Nirmala. At 5th September 1997, she Dies in Kolkata of heart failure at the age of 87.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2016, Mother Teresa was declared a saint by Pope Francis.</p>
